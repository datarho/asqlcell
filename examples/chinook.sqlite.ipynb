    "# Learn SQL with Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be looking at a novel approach to learn SQL solely with Jupyter Lab. Even though Jupyter Lab has become the handy tool for data scientists, SQL however is a missing piece from the picture. With the emmergence of [Analytical SQL Cell](https://github.com/datarho/asqlcell), SQL has become the first class citizen of Jupyter Lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of learning SQL with Jupyter Lab are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy to bootstrap. Analytical SQL Cell widget for Jupyter Lab is all you need.\n",
    "2. Extremely efficient. Analytical SQL Cell will leverage [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) to query and visualize data in a performant way.\n",
    "3. Free and open source. No commercial database or ChatGPT is required :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a database called Chinook which contains information about a fictional music shop. In this tutorial, data is stored in a [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chinook is a sample database for MySQL, SQL Server, etc. It is an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for demos. The name of this sample database was based on the Northwind database. Chinooks are winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. Therefore, Chinook is a good name choice for a database that intents to be an alternative to Northwind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The database includes several tables on invoice, track, album, artist etc. related to the store's sales. The Entity Relationship Diagram of the database is provided as follows:\n",
