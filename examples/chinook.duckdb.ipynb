    "# Business Questions on Chinook Music Store\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be looking at a database called Chinook which contains information about a fictional music shop. The database includes several tables on invoice, track, album, artist etc. related to the store's sales. We will use this database to explore business questions and propositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of this approach are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Easy to bootstrap. Analytical SQL Cell widget for Jupyter Lab is all you need.\n",
    "2. Extremely efficient. Analytical SQL Cell will leverage [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) to query and visualize data in a performant way.\n",
    "3. Free and open source. No commercial database or ChatGPT is required :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chinook is a sample database available for SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc. It is an alternative to the Northwind database, being ideal for demos and testing ORM tools targeting single and multiple database servers. The name of this sample database was based on the Northwind database. Chinooks are winds in the interior West of North America, where the Canadian Prairies and Great Plains meet various mountain ranges. Chinooks are most prevalent over southern Alberta in Canada. Chinook is a good name choice for a database that intents to be an alternative to Northwind.\n",
