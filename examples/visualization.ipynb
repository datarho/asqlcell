    "# Use the Right Chart for Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data charts are very useful to summarize and communicate large amounts of data. They can reveal patterns and insights that might not be obvious from the raw data. Different charts have different purposes so choosing the right one can be challenging. A good data visualization depends on matching the chart type to the data and the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to consider several things when choosing a chart type. What kind of data do you want to show? Who will see your chart â€“ is it for your own analysis or for a wider audience? What is the main message that you want to convey?\n",

    "## What is a sunburst chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "A sunburst chart is a type of hierarchical chart that is ideal for displaying hierarchical data. Each level of the hierarchy is represented by one ring or circle with the innermost circle as the top of the hierarchy. A sunburst chart without any hierarchical data looks similar to a doughnut chart. However, a sunburst chart with multiple levels of categories shows how the outer rings relate to the inner rings. The angle of each segment is either proportional to a value or divided equally under its parent node. It is typically used to visualize hierarchical data structures and consists of an inner circle surrounded by rings of deeper hierarchy levels.\n",

    "## When to use a sunburst chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sunburst charts are ideal for displaying hierarchical data. They are used to visualize how the outer rings relate to the inner rings and how each segment is proportional to a value or divided equally under its parent node. They can be used to show how one ring is broken into its contributing pieces, while another type of hierarchical chart, the treemap chart, is ideal for comparing relative sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some situations when you can use a sunburst chart are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To display sales data by region, product, and customer.\n",
    "* To display the organizational structure of a company.\n",
    "* To display website traffic by country, device, and browser.\n",
    "* To display product categories by brand, type, and price range.\n",
