    "# Use the Right Chart for Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data charts are very useful to summarize and communicate large amounts of data. They can reveal patterns and insights that might not be obvious from the raw data. Different charts have different purposes so choosing the right one can be challenging. A good data visualization depends on matching the chart type to the data and the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to consider several things when choosing a chart type. What kind of data do you want to show? Who will see your chart – is it for your own analysis or for a wider audience? What is the main message that you want to convey?\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will introduce you to the most common chart types that you can use with visualization tools. These charts will help you create effective data visualizations."

    "## What is a pie chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "A pie chart is a circular graph that shows how a total amount is divided into different parts based on a categorical variable. The size of each part (or slice) of the pie chart indicates the proportion or percentage of the total that each part occupies123. A pie chart is a type of pictorial representation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use pie chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use a pie chart when you want to show the relationship of different parts to the whole. A pie chart works best with categorical data that has a limited number of categories. A pie chart can help you emphasize how one part is overrepresented or underrepresented in the whole. A pie chart can also show the percentage or proportion of each part in the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some situations when you can use a pie chart are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you want to show the market share of different smartphone brands.\n",
    "* When you want to show the distribution of blood types among a population.\n",
    "* When you want to show the budget allocation of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the slices easier to compare, they should be arranged logically, usually from largest to smallest. This way, the user can understand the data better by looking at the biggest piece first and then the smaller ones. The slices should have the same colors as their corresponding labels in the legend, so that viewers can identify them without checking the legend too often.\n",
