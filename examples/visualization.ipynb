    "# Use the Right Chart for Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Data charts are very useful to summarize and communicate large amounts of data. They can reveal patterns and insights that might not be obvious from the raw data. Different charts have different purposes so choosing the right one can be challenging. A good data visualization depends on matching the chart type to the data and the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to consider several things when choosing a chart type. What kind of data do you want to show? Who will see your chart â€“ is it for your own analysis or for a wider audience? What is the main message that you want to convey?\n",
